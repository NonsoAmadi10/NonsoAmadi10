## About Me
I build secure, reliable, and cryptographically sound systems.
My background in Site Reliability Engineering and infrastructure gives me a strong foundation for designing and scaling distributed systems that prioritize trust, verifiability, and resilience.

Now, I’m diving deep into applied cryptography — focusing on Zero-Knowledge Proofs, secure computation, and privacy-preserving infrastructure for the next generation of internet protocols.

- 🧰 Current Role: Senior SRE at [Bitnob](https://bitnob.com) — building Bitcoin & Lightning infrastructure for Africa
- 🧱 Focus Areas: Cryptography, Zero-Knowledge Systems, Secure Infrastructure
- 🧩 Background: Cloud, Kubernetes, DevOps, Infrastructure Security
- 🌍 Location: Abuja, Nigeria → Preparing for relocation to Europe/Canada (2026)
- 🎯 Goal (2025–2026): Transition into Security & Cryptography Engineering, specializing in ZK Infrastructure and Proof Systems


## 💻 What I Do
I’m focused on bringing cryptographic guarantees into real-world distributed systems.
That means blending infrastructure engineering with applied research and practical system design.

- 🔐 Applied Cryptography: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs), MPC, signatures
- 🧩 Security Engineering: Threat modeling, key management, supply-chain hardening
- 🔧 Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Helm)
- 🧱 Infrastructure: Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm, ArgoCD
- 🚀 CI/CD Pipelines
- 🔐 Infrastructure Security & Compliance
- 🧠 Blockchain Systems: Bitcoin, Lightning, EVM & zkEVM ecosystems
- 🧮 Programming: Go, Python, Rust (learning), Bash
- 🧰 Tooling: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, OpenTelemetry

## 🏆 Achievements

- 🔭 Building Bitcoin + Lightning infrastructure at scale (Bitnob)
- 🧹 Migrated legacy infrastructure to Kubernetes with zero downtime
- 🔭 Built observability pipelines for high-fidelity alerting
- 🔐 Supported compliance readiness for PCI-DSS, SOC 2, ISO standards
- 🧠 Implemented internal security automation in CI/CD pipelines
- 🧮 Currently researching Zero-Knowledge Proofs and cryptographic primitives for infrastructure security
